# Building-on-Avalanche-Project-Degen-Token-ERC-20-Unlocking-the-Future-of-Gaming

This Solidity program serves as a Module 4 Project showcasing the fundamental syntax and functionalities of the Solidity programming language, complemented by integration with JavaScript.

# Description:

The project entails a straightforward implementation of a smart contract in Solidity, specifically designed for deployment on the Avalanche network to support Degen Gaming. The primary objective is to establish an ERC20 token with essential features beneficial to gaming environments. Key functionalities of the smart contract include:

Token Minting: This capability allows the platform to create new tokens, which are then distributed to players as rewards. The minting process is restricted to the contract owner, ensuring controlled token supply management.

# Token Transfers: 

Players can freely transfer their tokens to other participants within the gaming ecosystem. This facilitates transactions and enhances liquidity within the platform.

# Token Redemption: 

Players have the opportunity to redeem their tokens for various items offered in the in-game store. This feature incentivizes token acquisition and engagement.

Token Balance Inquiry: Participants can easily check their token balances at any time, providing transparency and enabling informed decisions regarding token utilization.

Token Burning: To manage token supply and optimize utility, participants have the option to burn tokens they no longer need. This action reduces the total supply of tokens in circulation.
